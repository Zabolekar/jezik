# Special symbols used in the database

* **œ** = **о** after most consonants, **е** after soft and sibilant consonants: *добрœ̄г* = *добро̄г*, *лошœ̄г* = *лоше̄г*

* **ӥ** = **и** after most consonants, **none** after **ј** (with lengthening of the previous vowel): *звонӥ* = *звони*, *дојӥ* = *до̄ј*

* **й** = auxiliary jekavian symbol for correct accenting of **ије**; subsequently becomes **и** in ijekavian with influence on accent

* **ꙓ** = **ије** in non-ekavian variants when long; **је** or **е** when short; becomes **и** (long or short) before **о**, **ј**
* !! apparently remains **ије** when long before **љ**, **њ**

* **ꙓ** = **е** (long or short) in ekavian; **NB**: **ије** is considered two syllables in ijekavian and one syllable in jekavian, that's why it is written **йје** (with a special symbol) in jekavian

* **ѣ** = **је** (short or long) in non-ekavian variants; probably **и** (short or also long?) before **о**, **ј**, **љ**, **њ**

* **ѣ** = **е** (short or long) in ekavian

* **ȷ** = PSl yod palatalization (*видȷено* = *виђено*)

* **ʺ** = PSl first palatalization (*богʺе* = *боже*)

* **ʹ** = PSl second palatalization (*богʹима* = *бозима*)

* **ˌ** = sign for sewing the root and the suffix of nesti-verbs together: *плетˌти* produces *плести*, *плетˌла* produces *плела*

* **·** = a place in a morpheme right after the vowel on which the accent *may* be put; occurs one or zero times in a morpheme; if zero, then the morpheme is never accented; if one, everything's clear; if two, this is most likely an error

* **•** = an auxiliary symbol when garde-ing a word (should be defined and commented more thoroughly in future)

* **0** = such a **·** (accentable place) in a morpheme which causes the accent to fall on the firstmost syllable of the word instead of on the morpheme itself, leaving a vowel length on the morpheme instead

* **ʘ** = **0** in some APs, zero in other APs

* **ъ** = **а** or zero letter depending on the forthcoming ending (**колъц*). historically, almost always comes from a real PSl yer.

* **ꚜ** = the same but NOT lengthening the previous vowel before a sonorant (*земꚜља*). historically, corresponds to an inserted vowel, not to a yer.
* NB: We try to use **ъ** and **ꚜ** historically, and only when it doesn't work then we take the other option (*каръта*)

* **ø** = marker of an ending which causes **ъ** to become **а**

* **Ъ** = **ъ** or zero (two variants) before an ending containing **ø**, else **ъ**

* **!** = marker of non-initial falling tone

* **ʌ** = **о** before a fallen yer, **л** elsewhere

* **ʟ** = **ʌ** or **л** (two variants)

* **¦** = barrier to NOT palatalize k,g,h in declension; **¦¦** for optional palatalizing *kavgi/kavzi*
