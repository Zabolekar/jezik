# Special symbols used in the database

* **œ** = **о** after most consonants, **е** after soft and sibilant consonants: *добрœ̄г* = *добро̄г*, *лошœ̄г* = *лоше̄г*

* **й** = **и** after most consonants, **none** after **ј** (with lenthening of the previous vowel): *звонй* = *звони*, *дојй* = *до̄ј*

* **ӥ** = auxiliary symbol for correct accenting of ије; becomes и̯ in jekavian regardless accent; becomes **и** in ijekavian with influence on accent

* **Ꙓ** = **ије** in non-ekavian variants when long; **је** or **е** when short; becomes **и** (long or short) before **о**, **ј**, **љ**, **њ**

* **ꙓ** = **е** (long or short) in ekavian; **NB**: **ије** is considered two syllables in ijekavian and one syllable in jekavian, that's why it is written **и̯је** (with a special symbol) in jekavian
